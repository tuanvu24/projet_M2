{"text": " What do you see going on in the picture? Well, Mother is drying the plate. The water is running on the floor, running in the sink. The kid is taking cookies from the cookie jar. And on the eye chair that would reach up to the cupboard. And the girl is receiving the cookies. The sister, I suppose, the little girl, the little boy, is taking the cookies from the little girl. He's handing them to her. And that would be they're eating them too, because I like cookies. My hand is always in the cookie jar. And the Mother is drying the dishes. The water is running over. She's not paying any neverminds to it, I guess. The floor is getting wet. She'll have to get them off to mop it up. How about over here? Anything else going on over here? Well, the chair is, the kid is going to fall from the stool, the high stool. And he's stumping over and he's going to land on his rear end pretty soon. There might be a couple cookies in his hand. Probably the cookie jar is still filled too. My kid is fed with them. To the floor. Yeah. Okay. That's about all. The sink is running over. The water is dripping on the floor, all over the floor.
