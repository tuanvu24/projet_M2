{"text": " There it is. Okay, the picture is in a kitchen with a family, a mother and a son and daughter. And the son is up in the cookie jar. The cover door is open. He's getting cookies in the jar. He's standing on a stool, which is in the process of toppling over. The little girl is holding out her hand for a cookie and she also has her finger to her lips, shushing him so he doesn't make any noise. The mother seems to be oblivious to what's going on. She's standing there wiping a dish and the tap water running the sink is overflowing down onto the floor and she's standing in a puddle. The little girl looks outside and the curtains are open and see what looks like. It could be a garage or an extension of the house, shrubbery, path, tree. Going back in the kitchen on the counter beside her is another plate and a cream and sugar bowl set. The little boy's shoes, he looks like he has jogging shoes on and low socks and he's wearing shorts and a short-sleeve shirt. His sister is wearing what amounts to sort of a mini dress, mini skirt with sandals. And let's see, there are ruffled curtains at the window that are drawn back by draw drapes. The cupboards all have recessed handles. Well, no, they're not recessed. At first glance they're recessed but actually they protrude out from the doors. And also copyright 1972.
