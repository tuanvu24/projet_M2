{"text": " What can you see going on in that picture? Well, I'm seeing a lot of water that isn't supposed to be where it is. A full sink with more water running down all along the floor. A stool that's going to project somebody into a fall real fast. Getting out of the cookie jar. Dish washing and drying. And a girl trying to say silence so that they won't be caught. Two cups and a plate that probably are dry and then the other plate is being dried. A covered door that's open. That's stool though, I don't know what he's going to do with that. I don't know why the sink's left, why the water's left on. It's going to make a mess. She's drying the plate or the dishes or whatever it is that she's working on. Of course that covered door is open. If it hadn't been opened, why, maybe he wouldn't have gotten his cookie. Anything else? Well, otherwise it's, except for the actual accidents, it's not too bad.
