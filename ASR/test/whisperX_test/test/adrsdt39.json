Can you see anything else? What else is going on? This is the cupboard up here. Here somebody ate and left their dish set. This one's dry in the dishes. What else do you see going on here? This lady's drying dishes. Do you see anything else going on? That's a cookie jar and a little boy's on a ladder trying to get cookies. Okay, let me take that away.", "label": 0}
