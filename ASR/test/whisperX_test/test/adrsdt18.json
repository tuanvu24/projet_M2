And on the eye chair that would reach up to the cupboard. And the girl is receiving the cookies. The sister, I suppose, the little girl, the little boy, is taking the cookies in the little girl. He's handing them to her. And that'd be they're eating them too, because I like cookies. My hand is always in the cookie jar. And the mother is drying the dishes. The water's running over. Okay. He said she's not paying any never minds to it, I guess. The floor's getting wet, she'll have to get a mop to mop it up. How about over here? Anything else going on over here? Well the chair is, the kid's going to fall from the stool, the high stool, and stomping over and he's going to land on his rear end pretty soon. There might be a couple cookies in his hand, probably the cookie jar's still filled too, he might catch that when he's on the floor. Yeah. Okay. That's about all. Okay. The sink is running over, the water's dripping on the floor, all over the floor. The old lady will have to get a mop and mop up the floor, too, after she's done with the noun.", "label": 0}
