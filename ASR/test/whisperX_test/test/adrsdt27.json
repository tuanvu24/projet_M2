{"text": "It was summertime and mother and the children were working in the kitchen. The window was open and there was a slight breeze blowing in. Mother was daydreaming and forgot and left the water in the sink running and it was overflowing. The children were hungry and because they knew mother was distracted doing the dishes they did something they probably should not have done. They got the kitchen stool, moved it under the cupboard where the cookie jar was, and the young boy climbed up to get a cookie. Because he did not place his weight correctly on the stool, he's about to fall. He's probably hurting himself because his head's going to hit the kitchen cupboards. It looks like the house is set in the country. It's a large house. Either that or you're seeing another house, a wing of the house, this grass growing, a little path. That's good. Well, it looks pretty laid back there.", "label": 0}
