The mother is washing dishes and not paying attention to what she's doing. The sink is overflowing. There's a nice peaceful sign outside. Fortunately there's nothing happening out there. The uh, dishes on the counter in the sink. What's that? I don't accept that there's a boy and a girl and a mother or a woman. Good. Okay. But I did mention that. I said the boy was getting a cookie for the girl and the mother was washing dishes. Okay, good.", "label": 0}
