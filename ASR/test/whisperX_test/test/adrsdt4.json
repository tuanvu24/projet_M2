{"text": "Okay, all of the action. Okay, I see a boy in a cookie jar. I see he has a lid on. I see that he is standing on a three-legged stool, and he's about to depart from that three-legged stool. He has one cookie he's handed down to his sister, and she's reaching up for it. and I think she's indicating to the boy to keep still so his mother doesn't hear what's going on. I see the mother, I guess she's drying the dishes. She's not paying attention because she's leaving the sink run over and swimming all over the floor. She must not be conscious because she's standing there and doesn't know it. I think she's probably looking out the windows. I take the second one. And I see, apparently, a couple of the bigger dishes on the table top. I see, like, cupboards, I don't know whether they all have knobs on them or not. Doesn't look like the two boys and girls have a knock on the cover door. And I see outside, I see a tree, some shrubbery, some edges. Okay. That it? Okay, good.", "label": 0}
