What's happening in that picture? Well... This is the boy trying to get the cookie jar down for his sister, I would imagine it is. And he's going to fall off the ladder off the... Um... The stool or whatever he said. Mother's over here, she just dropped some water or whatever on the floor. She looks pretty mad. And the water's still running. And it looks like the girl is laughing at the boy. Because the stool's going to fall over. And there's water on the floor there and some cups and so forth. Okay. Thank you.", "label": 0}
