{"text": "Tell me what you see going on in this picture. I don't see nothing. What's the noise? Somebody put some pencils or something and went up the dino. Can you see what's going on in that picture? I see a ghost. Okay tell me what else you see. Some little box or something. I don't know. All of a lot of it in the car. Some kind of a flower. I don't know. And a girl is there. There's something up there. There's another girl. What else do you see going on in the picture? What's going on right here in this picture? What's happening there? Looks like some old girl is in there. What else is going on? Lots of things. Can you tell me what's going on on this side of the picture? You're looking at me like this, are you? I've set some things up there. What are you talking about? I guess that I look about the same, but you've got this thing here. It looks like a little river. Uh huh. Can you see anything else in that picture? I'm sorry I didn't bring my glasses. Maybe we can try another time when you have your glasses. It does help to have.", "label": 0}
