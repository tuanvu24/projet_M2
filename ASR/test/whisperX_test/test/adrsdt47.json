{"text": "Tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Tell me everything that's happening there. A young boy is up at the cookie jar. He has a cookie jar opened. He's reaching for one for himself. He's handing one down to his sister. The three-legged stool is coming down with him. They're nicely dressed kids, but the boy needs his socks pulled up. That's all I see there. Mother, I presume it's mother, is at the sink. The water is running over out of the sink. She's drying a dish. She's looking out the window. There are two cups and a dish. I presume that's a dish that are already dry, I guess, and sitting on the side of the sink. Nicely groomed. Nice curtains pulled back. It's apparently somewhere outside because the windows open and it looks like shrubs are growing. You can see a window in the other part of the house. I presume that's still their house. And there's a driveway bordered with grass. And there's a tree out there somewhere that you can see part of the trunk and part of the foliage. And I see cabinets around the kitchen, other cabinets. And that's about it.", "label": 0}
