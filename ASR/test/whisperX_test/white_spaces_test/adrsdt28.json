{"text": "There's a picture. What do you tell me? Just tell me everything that you see. Um, the girl was talking to the boy. He's getting the cookie jar down. He has a cookie in his hand. . He's falling off of his stool. . The mother's doing the dishes and the water's running off into the floor. She's looking out the window apparently. . I see grass and lawn outside. I see two bowls, cabinets. . Anything else? You want everything I can see? Yeah. I also see a cabinet door here. What's happening over here? Remember I said the water was over there? Yeah. Sorry, is there a glare on that? Do you know, sometimes the light glares on it. I like glares on it. . That's fine. It doesn't look different. There's nothing inside here. It's only the major things that are happening. That's fine. Okay, thank", "label": 0}
