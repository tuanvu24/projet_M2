but do i see in this picture this reminds me probably of when i was very young okay mom is washing the dishes i don't know why she's not looking at the kids who are getting into the cookie jar and the young birds about of course to chop over cause the steel shipping but why the waters overflowing in the sink i have no idea she seemed so serene and yet so out of it but not paying attention without going out and that's what i see in that picture over looking about yard of course which is neatly should always have the window in the kitchen
