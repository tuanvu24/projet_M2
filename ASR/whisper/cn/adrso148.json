{"text": " This should make us laugh. Are you ready? Are you ready? Well, the sink is overflowing. Mother is standing in the water like a jerk. She's wiping the dishes also like a jerk. The boy is trying to get a cookie out of the cookie jar, but boy, he's about to fall off the stool. His sister has her hand up her finger up to her mouth like she's saying, Shh, be quiet. Tell my mother I know what you're doing. And he's about to hand her a cookie, but in a few moments it's going to be like total catastrophe. The reason the water is flowing out of the sink is because the water is running furiously. I'm looking out through the window and I don't see anything going on out there. Unless, that's just a bush I'm presuming or a plum pudding. I told you the stool was about to go over. In a moment there's going to be real chaos which will make what's going on in the picture look like nothing. The cookie jar is full, the lid is off the cookie jar. Do you want me to tell you all those things? Tell me all the things you see going on in the picture. The cabinet door has just swung open and the stool is about to fall. I guess I've told you that with the terrible crash. Mother is daydreaming. She doesn't even know what's going on behind her. I think that's very important and sometimes typical. It seems true.
