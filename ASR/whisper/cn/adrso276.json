{"text": " Oh, it's the same picture. You should give me a different one. We're afraid to. Why? It would be more fun if you had some variety. That's probably true. Okay. We have here a scene in the kitchen, and it looks as though that's a mama who is working at the sink and her two children. And the two children are hoping that mama will not notice, because she's looking out the window, that they are getting into the cookie jar. So the boy climbs up on a stool to reach the cookie jar, and as he's getting up there, the stool is tilting, and he looks as though he were about to fall over. And the little girl is telling him to be quiet by putting her finger on her lips. He has one cookie in his hand, is reaching for another one. The lid is off the cookie jar. The cover door is open. He's supposedly going to hand one cookie, it looks as though he is, to his sister and grab another one for himself. But I doubt that he's going to get all that done before the stool falls over. On the other, around the corner of the kitchen, there's a counter that sort of turns a corner. There are cupboards below the counter and above the counter where the cookies are. Then when you get over and have turned a corner in the kitchen, you have base cabinets, and then you have a window above that, which is looking out into something which makes it look as though it's summer outside, because the window is open, there are things growing out there, there's a walk, there's some shrubbery underneath another window that looks as though it's in another wing of the house. There's a tree beyond. There are tie-back curtains at the window. The mother is working at the sink, and the faucet is left on, and apparently there's no overflow in the sink, so it's overflowing right onto the floor, splice, splice. And she has on a sleeveless dress, which also indicates that it's summer. It looks as though she has an apron on. She has short hair. She is drying a dish with a tea towel, a plate with a tea towel. Beside the sink, there are two cups and a plate. Looks as though there's some suds and some dishes in the sink, and two faucets with X-type handles, one on either side and the center faucet. She has shoes on with no ties, just sort of slip-on shoes. There's a little scalloped valance across the top of the curtains. Hmm. I think that's all I'm going to tell you. Well, the handles on the door are the kind that are just almost like a round piece of wood that you have to get ahold of to pull the cupboard door open. And what's really strange is that you can't see any handles on the cupboards or on the other side of the kitchen.
