{"text": " Just look at this one and tell me everything you see going on. My mom... Mom ain't having a good day. She's not having a good day at all. The kids are in the cookie jar. And the... not the ladder, but the high chair is turning over. She's preoccupied with him even though she's not looking at him. And she forgot to turn her water off and her sink is overflowing. Getting her floor wet. And her daughter, little boy's sister, she's just laughing. She's having a ball. She's enjoying every minute of this. But at the same time, she wants to cook it before you fall. And it's just kind of a chaotic day for her. But she seems to have a smile on her face. I guess she said, well, it's all in her day. I'll just deal with it as it comes.
