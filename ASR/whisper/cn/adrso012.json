{"text": " Well, I see a kitchen and a housewife or homemaker at the sink and her two kids are having a great time. She is drying a dish as her sink overflows. She must be blind, but that's her doing. So the kid is about to fall, successfully gotten a cookie out of the cookie jar. That's the boy who is up on a stool and the daughter is there trying to grab the cookie I guess from the boy. What else, it looks like a nice yard in back with a bit of a garden and some grass. I believe she is standing in the water. It still bothers me that she has gone blind, that she can't, well she will feel it soon on her feet when the water hits her.
