{"text": " Here's the picture. Alrighty, our reaction I see is a little girl with her finger up to her mouth and one arm extended up, looking up at the boy who's reaching up to the cookie jar with his right hand reaching for the cookie. With his left hand, he already has a cookie, it almost looks like the girl's trying to reach for the cookie in the lower left hand. He's standing on the stool, tipping over, and looks like he's about ready to fall. The woman in the sink, looks like she's wiping a dish with a rag in her hand, holding the dish with the other hand, and water's flowing into the sink and over the sink. It looks like she's not paying attention to it. The water's just flowing out of the sink and all over the floor and she's stepping into the water too. So, that's called action. And ranching outside the window. Okay, good.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.0, "text": " Here's the picture.
