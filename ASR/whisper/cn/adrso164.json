{"text": " What do you see going on? I see a little boy on the stool, almost falling over, taking cookies out of the cookie jar. And the little girl is putting her finger to her mouth to keep it quiet. The mother is washing dishes. She's drying the dishes and letting the water keep on running in the sink, and the water is running over. And she's standing in the water that's running over. There's a window there she's looking at, at the grass and the flowers. And the curtains seem to be shaking from the wind and the air that's blowing in. The dishes that she's through drying are sitting on the sink top. And the little girl is raising her hands for the little boy to hand her a cookie. And he has one cookie in his hand and he's going after another one. And he's ready to hand her a cookie. The mother is holding a dishcloth that she's drying the dishes with. She has a platter that she's drying. I don't see any other action.
