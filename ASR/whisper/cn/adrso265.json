No. He's getting cookies out of the cookie jar. He's falling off the stool. He's got two cookies already. He's getting one for his sister and he's going to have one. Even if he falls, he's going to have his cookies. She has her finger up to her mouth. I don't know what she's saying. Sure, I want one too. I don't know how the mother can be so unaware.
