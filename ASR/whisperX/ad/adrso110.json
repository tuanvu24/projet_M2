{"text": "Okay, can you tell me everything you see going on in the picture? This boy over here is standing on the chair that's falling over. The girl down below, the boy's up there, has a cookie jar up there. He's putting cookies in and the thing's falling over. Then there was the lady, she was washing dishes and drying them. And the sink was turned on and the water was running down and running on the floor and she was standing in the water. She's got a dress on and she's looking out past scrapes down here and she's looking out through the window. Looks like that boy's going to fall over pretty soon. Okay.", "label": 1}
