An average home that looks very much like ours many times and the mother is, well she's spilling her water which is not very good but she's washing dishes and drying them and one of the children upsets cookie jar and that's a very average thing to go in in a home. It's a very active family and so that it makes it kind of hard at our house sometimes because there's a lot of activity. Okay, you see anything else going on over here? Well, the poor girl is spilling the water on her feet. It's going to be wet but she'll have to struggle with that. Also, there are a few more dishes that didn't get finished. has to be the dishes and how that little boy fell off that stool I don't know but he did. Anything else? No.", "label": 1}
