And they watched that on the island. And the big sister watching the dishes at the sink. She got dishes on this sitting on the sink. I think she's running water. Can you tell me anything else that's going on over there? Like I said, little sister's reaching. Johnny, he is up on the ladder getting some cookies and little sister reaching up after her. Anything? He's passing down to her. Okay, anything else? And then the ladder about to turn over. Okay. Anything else going on over here? Uh, this the cups what she's uh, Maybe she doesn't wash them if you got them sitting on this on the sink. Uh-huh And maybe running water on this thing. And you got a kind of crazy pool that you might get some light in there. Some dishes, dishes stacked up. They might be on this thing. Anything else? Nothing but all that. Okay, good.", "label": 1}
