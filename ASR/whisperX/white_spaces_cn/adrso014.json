Maybe she's just the caretaker or the babysitter and maybe that would give her a reason for being a little disengaged here. But at any rate, the boy is about to have an accident. He may very well pull the whole cookie jar down with him. . And this woman is oblivious to the fact that the sink is running over. . As soon as it gets ankle deep, I think she'll wake up. And when she hears the crash, she definitely will be brought to to the present. . Otherwise it looks like a beautiful day outside. Is there anything else . Is there anything else I should say about this", "label": 0}
