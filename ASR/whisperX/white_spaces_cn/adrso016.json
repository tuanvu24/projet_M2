{"text": "Hmm, a lot of fall and safety problems. So this boy is getting cookies from a cookie jar and the stool is tipping. Not sure what his sister is doing. I think she just wants a cookie. But the mother's not paying attention to the water falling out of the sink. And she's drying dishes. So I'm not sure. And she's seen any water and there's a nice window, but I don't see anything much else going on. Thank", "label": 0}
