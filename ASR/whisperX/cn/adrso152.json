{"text": "The little boy is on the stool which is tipping over and he's getting into the cookie jar which is up in the cabinet. The lid is off the jar. He has a cookie in one hand and another one in the other. The little girl has her hand up for a cookie I guess to take him in one hand and it's up to her mouth like she doesn't want Mother to know. Mother's doing the dishes at the sink and the sink is overflowing. The water's overflowing on the floor. She's drying a dish. There's some, looks like two cups that are in play with the counter. Inside the window, looks like a pan. There's another window. And some trees. Some grass and some shrubs. And it's either, I guess it's another part of the house because there's a curtain. She has an apron on.", "label": 0}
