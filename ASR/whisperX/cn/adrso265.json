{"text": "Now you just look at the picture and you tell me everything that's going on, okay? This is going to be like looking at those artistic things and fiddling when we get there. We're going to be at her dishwashers and her dish sink is overflowing on the floor because the faucet is running. And she's standing in it yet. Her kiddos are robbing the job and the little boy is falling off the stool. He's getting some cookies though. And the girl doesn't have her as yet. I don't think the perspective on the corners is right in the room. You want honey dishes? Two cups and a plate on the counter. And she's drawing a plate. And you want to put these curtains on the window so you can tie back. And what pretty view out there. You see the wing of the house, the living room, and the path around the house. And the landscaping is bushes up close. And the everything is in stock. Outside there's grass in the ground. And there's a tree in every house. OK. Could you repeat to me what you said over there? No. Didn't get it out. He's not getting cookies out of the cookie jar. He's falling off the stool. He's gotten two cookies already. He's giving one to his sister and he's going to have one. Even if he falls, he's going to have his cookies. She has her finger up to her mouth. I don't know what she's saying. Sure, I want one too. I don't know how the mother can be so unaware. That's fine. Thank you.", "label": 0}
