{"text": "There's the picture. This little boy has his hand in the cookie jar. He has gotten up on a stool, which is tipping over. And just standing there wanting some cookies too. And all of this is behind their mother's back. She's washing dishes. The water's running over. She must be daydreaming. The water's running over onto the floor. She doesn't seem to notice it. There are a couple dishes there. She must be drying the dishes. They look dried on the counter. The one in your hand. I thought she just taken them out. And then back, there's a yard. A sidewalk. And another wing of the house with a window. And a curtain. A curtain is there. A window. About to sink. She's a nice big brat. And a little book on the window of the next room. There he is. She's like coming in. You did fine, that's great.", "label": 0}
