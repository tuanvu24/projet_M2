{"text": "Here's a picture. Okay. Alright. The mother's washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing. She has some of them dried already on the side as she's looking out the window. A little boy is falling off the stool as he's getting into the cookie jar to give to his little sister who's reaching up to get the cookie also. There's water all over the floor and there's the garden is outside and the mother is not paying any attention to what they do. The stool is tipping, the door is open. There may be a little breeze coming in because this window is open. The little girl is saying, has her finger to her mouth, We won't tell mother while you give me the cookie. It's in the kitchen of course and the cups, two cups in the dish already have been dried and the mother is stepping in the water and she's probably so engrossed in what she's doing outside she neither knows what the children are doing nor is she paying any attention that the water is overflowing. Okay, good.", "label": 0}
