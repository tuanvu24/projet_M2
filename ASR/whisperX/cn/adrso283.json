{"text": "There's the picture. It doesn't matter where you start, right? Alright, there's a... a little boy on a step stool which is tilted. And he's getting some cookies. Now do you want descriptive as far as the cookie lids or how they are or just the action? Just the action. Okay, and it looks like he's trying to hand a cookie to his sister. She kind of has her finger up towards her mouth. Like she might be giggling. The mother is drying dishes but the water is overflowing onto the floor. The sink looks like it is almost tilted. Now would you call the cup of the saucers? That's not action, right, is it? No, you don't. The breeze might be blowing. The curtains look like they might be. No action. I don't see anything else. Just see the outdoors, but I don't see anything. That's about it, I guess. That's it. That's it.", "label": 0}
