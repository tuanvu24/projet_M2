{"text": "I want you to tell me everything that you see going on in this picture. Everything that you see happening here. Go ahead. Well, for one thing, the boy is stealing cookies. And the girl is asking for a cookie. And the boy is standing on a stool, which is tipping over. And the lady's drying a plate. And the water is running in the sink and overflowing on the floor and getting her feet wet. And the window is open. I don't know if there's anything special going on outside the window. It seems to me that that's essentially the things that are going on in this picture. The girl is picking her nose. The boy is handing her a cookie. Really, those are the only activities I see. Okay.", "label": 0}
