There's more water going over it, and it's splashing onto the floor. And the boy's falling off the stool, getting cookies from the cookie jar. And the girl's putting her finger up to her lip, which means I won't tell her something like that. Shoes are getting wet in the morning. Looking outside, we don't see it doing anything. Snowy? I don't have too much time to add. All the action I see is the water spilling over and the buoy falling off the stool. Okay, fine. I don't know if that snow is action. I don't see it snowing. It looks light out there. I don't know.", "label": 0}
